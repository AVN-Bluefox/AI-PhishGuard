AI-powered phishing detection tool using NLP & Machine learning

AI-PhishGuard

PROBLEM STATEMENT
        Phishing attacks remain one of the top cybersecurity threats, tricking users into revealing sensitive information. Traditional detection methods rely on static rules, which can be bypassed. This project 
        will use AI to analyze email content, URLs, and metadata to detect phishing attempts with high accuracy.

SOLUTION OVERVIEW
        Train an AI model to classify emails/messages as phishing or safe.
        Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze email text.
        Scan URLs using Machine Learning models.
        Possibly integrate with browser extensions or email security tools.
